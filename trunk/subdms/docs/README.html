<h2><a name="Goals"></a>I. Goals</h2>
The goal with this project is to create a full-fledged DMS based on subversion 
to handle the most common Office document file formats, 
primarily Open Document Format (ODF).
 
<h2><a name="Setup"></a>II. How to set-up Subdms</h2>
<ol type="1" style="list-style-type='upper-roman'" start="1">
<li>Install the subdms package, see INSTALL file for details.</li>

<li>Have a look in the config file /etc/subdms/subdms.cfg to see where the stuff
gets installed, and change that if you like. Also you might want to change 
the default editors for the different file types.</li> 

<li> <br>
  <ol type="a" style="list-style-type='upper-roman'" start="1">
    <li>If you have used version 0.1 of subdms to store a larger
      amount of documents <br>
      you might want to upgrade to the newer 0.2 version, see UPGRADE file for 
      details.</li>  
    
    <li>With a new clean install, you have to initiate the server-side of subdms by 
    running the following command in the terminal:<br>

  <code>
    > subdms-server<br> 
  </code>
    
    This will setup the workspace directory, the database and the
    repository.<br></li>
</li>  
</ol>
<li>Run the client by typing: <br>
  <code>
    > subdms</li>     
</code>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Howto"></a>III. How to use</h2>
Using the graphical user interface:<br>

Note: There is a Right-click menu available that corresponds to the "Tools" 
      menu in the menubar.<br>

<ol type="1" style="list-style-type='upper-roman'" start="1">
<li>Start by adding a new project using the menu entry <br>
    "Create" -> "New Project". Note that the "Project Acronym" field must be
    filled in. The acronym would usually be a three letter abbreviation of the 
    full project name. The full name can be entered in the "Project name" field.</li>

<li> Creating a Document can be done in three ways using the Menu entry
    "Create" -> "New Document".</li> 

    a. From Template: Create document from a built-in template file
    b. From File: adding a existing file to the DMS.
    c. From Document: Base the document on an existing document in the DMS.

<li> List all documents using Menu "View" -> "List Documents".</li> 

<li> List all templates using Menu "View" -> "List Templates".</li> 

<li> To get more information about a document use the "Tools" -> "Document Info".
    In this dialog you can also edit the document title and the document 
    keywords, Press the "Save" button to apply any changes.</li>

<li> View document. Select document in the document list. 
    Use menu entry "Tools" -> "View Document"
    This will display a read-only copy of the document in a viewer/editor 
    defined in: /etc/subdms/sumbdms.cfg	</li>
   
<li> Edit document. Select document in the document list. 
    Use menu entry "Tools" -> "Edit Document"
    This will launch an editor defined in /etc/subdms/sumbdms.cfg.</li>

<li> Commit Changes. As with subversion or any other version control systems, 
    local changes made to the document can be committed to the central 
    repository. Select the document in the list and use 
    "Tools" -> "Commit Changes", this will launch a dialog where a 
    commit message can be entered.</li>

<li> Check-in document. To remove the local copy of the document, select the 
    document in the list and use "Tools" -> "Check-in Document". 
    This will commit any local changes made to the document and remove 
    the local copy from workspace.</li>

<li> Release document. The "Release Document" action also resides in the "Tools"
    Menu. Select the document you want to release in the document list. 
    This action will check-in your document, set its to status "released", 
    and any prior issues to status "obsolete". Both the status "released" and
    "obsolete" means that a document issue with one of these status can only be 
    checked out read-only, and no more changes can be made to those issues.</li>  
 
<li> Create a new issue of the document. This action is found in the "Create" 
    menu as "New issue". As with the other actions, the document in question 
    must be selected in the document list. Note that this action only works on 
    documents with status "released".</li>  

<li> Obsolete Document. The last entry in the "Tools" menu is this option. 
    Whatever the current status of the document, the user can always choose to
    set the document status to obsolete. To be on the safe side the user has to
    confirm this action via a pop-up dialog box pressing the "Yes" button.
    Hopefully the concept of and obsolete document is obvious to everyone. 
    It means that the validity of the document and the information within it 
    has expired. Its the final destination for a document, you can not change
    the status of an obsolete document nor can you base a new issue on it.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Doclist"></a>IV. Document list</h2>
The document list displays information of the created documents.<br> 
The first unnamed column displays the state of the document as
follows:<br>
<ul type="None">
<li>O = Document is Checked-out</li>    
<li>I = Document is Checked-in </li>    
<li>M = Document is locally modified</li>    
</ul>

<h2><a name="Cmduse"></a>V. Command-line usage</h2>
Usage: subdms add filename project doctype [title] <br>
<br>
Example:<br>
 > subdms add filename.txt myproject note "Technical note"<br>
or:<br>
 > subdms add "this project note.txt" myproject note<br>

This command line interface makes it possible to add documents in the DMS.
It is a compliment to add files via the graphical user interface.
And opens for the possibility to write scripts to automate the adding of files. 
If you enter a title, make sure the title is a string.
If no title is given the filename without extension is set as title.

<h2><a name="Supfile"></a>VI. Supported file types</h2>
The following file types are supported by default:

<ul type="None">
  <li>.odp  - open document presentation  </li>    
  <li>.ods  - open document spread sheet  </li>    
  <li>.odt  - open document text          </li>    
  <li>.pdf  - portable document format    </li> 
  <li>.tex  - latex                       </li>    
  <li>.txt  - plain text                  </li> 
  <li>.zip  - compressed archive	  </li> 
</ul>

Also if you want to define other file types which you want Subdms to handle
add the file extensions separated with blanks in the configuration file 
/etc/subdms/subdms.cfg:<br><br>

<code>
[User Defined]<br>
filetypes: jpg gif py<br>
</code><br>
In connection to adding additional file types you might also add an appropriate
editor/viewer for each of these types:<br><br>

<code>
[Editor]<br>
default: /usr/bin/emacs --file<br>
jpg: /usr/bin/gwenview<br>
gif: /usr/bin/krita<br>
py: /usr/bin/eric4 <br> 
</code><br>
If you do not specify a editor/viewer for a file type that you have added, 
subdms will revert to trying to open the document with the default 
viewer/editor which bin the above example means emacs. 

<h2><a name="Docinteg"></a>VII. Document Integration</h2>
Subdms integrates with your documents by setting values on a number fields:<br>
<br>
<table width="" cellspacing="" cellpadding="" border="=">
<tr>
<th>Field name </th>        
<th>Description</th>  
</tr>
<tr>
<td>subdmstitle	  </td>
<td>Document title</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>subdmsdocid	</td>    
<td>Document id </td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<td>subdmsissue    </td>       
<td>Document issue </td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<td>subdmsstatus</td>    
<td>Document Status</td>   
</tr>
<tr>
<td>subdmsrdate  </td>          
<td>Release date </td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<td>subdmsauthor </td>	  
<td>Author       </td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<td>subdmsproj	 </td>     
<td>Project name </td>  
</tr>
<tr>
<td>subdmskeyws       </td>    
<td>Document keywords </td>    
</tr>
</table> 
<br>

<h3>ODF-Files</h3>
Document integration for ODF-files i.e. .odt, .ods, and .odp files is done by 
Subdms setting the above fields. See the default .odt template document for an 
example. If you want document integration to work with your existing documents 
that that you add to the DMS you have to manually define these fields in your 
document before you add them. 

Once you have defined the fields you can use them as normal fields, inserting 
them wherever you like in the document. 

<h3>TeX-Files</h3>
For .tex files you define the fields as new commands in the top of your 
document, as seen below: 

<ul type="None">
  <li>\newcommand {\subdmstitle} {}  </li>    
  <li>\newcommand {\subdmsdocid} {}  </li>    
  <li>\newcommand {\subdmsissue} {}  </li>    
  <li>\newcommand {\subdmsstatus} {} </li> 
  <li>\newcommand {\subdmsrdate} {}  </li>    
  <li>\newcommand {\subdmsauthor} {} </li> 
  <li>\newcommand {\subdmsproj} {}   </li> 
  <li>\newcommand {\subdmskeyw} {}   </li> 
</ul>
Subdms will insert the values between the empty curly brackets to define the 
fields. <br>
<br>
When you edit the document you can use and position these fields where you 
want to have them, most commonly to define the frontpage of your 
document/report. For instance to use the title field to define the 
project name: <br>
<br>
<code>
{\Large \subdmsproj}\\  
</code>
<br>
This would give you the project name in a large text.  <br>
<br>
See the "default.tex" template for an example how the fields have been used.<br>
