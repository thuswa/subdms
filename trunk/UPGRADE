How to upgrade 
==============
Due to internal changes made to version 0.2 of subdms, the server-side from a 
previous version 0.1 install have to be upgraded. Using a script provided with 
the package the repository and database will be upgraded. The document tree in 
the repository will be copied to a new tree. Data is dumped from the old data 
base and then reorganized and inserted in a new database. The old database 
will be deleted.

Note that this upgrade method is not perfect. Release and obsolete dates will 
for instance not be correct. Also the upgrade process requires some manual 
actions taken by the user, so:  

!!! READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW CAREFULLY !!!
 
1. Make sure that all documents are checked-in.
2. Close the subdms client window.
3. run "subdms-upgrade" from the command-line.
4. Check that the documents are correctly converted. 
5. The old document tree is still present in the repository. 
   To remove this run the following command:
   svn rm file:///<path to repo>/trunk
    
   The post-commit hook will exit with an error. This error can be ignored.
