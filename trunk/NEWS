*2009-04-XX* Version 0.2.0 Released!

This version includes the following improvements:
 * Added document info dialog
 * Included option to Install templates
 * Included right-click menu in document list
 * Restrict commits on released and obsolete documents
 * Show-case document integration 
 * Added support for .zip and .pdf files 
 * Added support for Document Keywords 
 * Added option to change document title
 * Added view document option
 * Added support multi-line document titles
 * Disabled actions inappropriate for selected document
 * Improved the "New Project" dialog
 * Improved the "Commit Changes" dialog
 * Included upgrade script

The most exciting feature is the document integration, for now only .tex files 
support these feature, to see how it works base a document on the default.tex 
template and open it top see what happens, pretty close to magic if you ask me!


*2009-04-02* Version 0.1.0 Released!

This version is still alpha, although it is a significant improvement over the 
0.0.1 version, which justifies the jump in version number. 

This version includes the following improvements:
 * Improved user interface.
 * Improved document list.
 * Three ways to create documents: from template, from file, 
   from existing document
 * Ability to release documents.
 * Ability to create new issues of a document.
 * Support of .tex files. 
 * Command-line interface to add files to the DMS. 
 
There is no direct upgrade path from version 0.0.1 to 0.1.0, due to internal 
changes. You have to back up your documents, remove the database and 
repository, install the new version, and then re-add all documents back. 

*2009-03-17* Version 0.0.1 Released!

This alpha version implements the very basic functions of a Document 
Management System. 

With it you can:
 * Create projects and documents
 * List created documents 
 * Edit and check-in documents 
 
Atm the system can only handle text files, is not yet completely server/client,
and the user interface is very basic. All this will of course improve with the 
coming releases.
