*2009-07-XX* Version 0.3.0 Released!
  * ODF-support!!! Subdms now supports the Open Document format

  * Included check of server-side at client start-up.

*2009-05-06* Version 0.2.0 Released!

This version includes the following improvements:
 * Added document info dialog
 * Included option to Install templates
 * Included right-click menu in document list
 * Restrict commits on released and obsolete documents
 * Show-case document integration 
 * Added support for .zip and .pdf files

 * Added view document option
 * Added support multi-line document titles
 * Disabled actions inappropriate for selected document
 * Improved the "New Project" dialog
 * Improved the "Commit Changes" dialog
 * Included upgrade script

*Known problems: *
 * Document integration does not work for non us-ascii characters. So 
   avoid using non us-ascii in title, project name, document types and 
   keywords.

Notes:
 * The most exciting feature is the document integration, for now only .tex 
   files support these feature, to see how it works base a document on the 
   default.tex template and edit it to  see what happens, pretty close to 
   magic if you ask me!
 * The default .tex template sort of sucks though, so if have any ideas on 
   how to improve it, do not hesitate to contact me.  
 * If you have installed and used the previous 0.1.0 version you might want 
   to upgrade the subdms-server side, see the documentation for details.

*2009-04-02* Version 0.1.0 Released!

This version is still alpha, although it is a significant improvement over the 
0.0.1 version, which justifies the jump in version number. 

This version includes the following improvements:
 * Improved user interface.
 * Improved document list.
 * Three ways to create documents: from template, from file, 
   from existing document
 * Ability to release documents.
 * Ability to create new issues of a document.
 * Support of .tex files. 
 * Command-line interface to add files to the DMS. 
 
There is no direct upgrade path from version 0.0.1 to 0.1.0, due to internal 
changes. You have to back up your documents, remove the database and 
repository, install the new version, and then re-add all documents back. 

*2009-03-17* Version 0.0.1 Released!

This alpha version implements the very basic functions of a Document 
Management System. 

With it you can:
 * Create projects and documents
 * List created documents 
 * Edit and check-in documents 
 
Atm the system can only handle text files, is not yet completely server/client,
and the user interface is very basic. All this will of course improve with the 
coming releases.
