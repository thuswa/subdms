How to upgrade 
==============
Due to internal changes made to version 0.2 of subdms, the server-side from a 
previous version 0.1 install can not be used with the newer version, unless it 
is upgraded. The upgrade of the repository and the database can be performed 
using a script provided with the package. This script will copy the present 
document tree in the repository to a new tree. Also, the data contained in the 
old database will be extracted and then reorganized and inserted into a 
new database. The old database will be deleted.

Note that this upgrade method is not perfect. Release and obsolete dates will 
for instance not be correct. Also the upgrade process requires some manual 
actions taken by the user, so:  

!!! READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW CAREFULLY !!!
 
1. Make sure that all documents are checked-in.
2. Close the subdms client window if it is open.
4. Make sure that the database path and repository path in 
   /etc/subdms/subdms.cfg are correct.
5. run "subdms-upgrade" from the command-line.
6. Check that the documents are correctly converted. 
7. The old document tree is still present in the repository. 
   To remove this run the following command:
   svn rm file:///<path to repo>/trunk
    
   The post-commit hook will exit with an error. This error can be ignored.
