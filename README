Subdms - Subversion Based Document Management System
####################################################

Goals
-----
The goal with this project is to create a full-fledged DMS based on subversion 
to handle the most common Office document file formats, 
primarily Open Document Format (ODF).
 
How to use
----------
1. Install the subdms package, see INSTALL file for details.

2. Initiate the server-side of subdms by running the following command in the 
   terminal:
 
   > subdms-server
   
   This will setup the workspace directory, the database and the repository.
   Have a look in the config file etc/subdms/subdms.cfg to see where the stuff
   gets installed. Also you might want to change the default editor (emacs). 

3. Run the client by typing:
   
   > subdms
