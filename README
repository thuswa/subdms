Subdms - Subversion Based Document Management System
####################################################

Goals
-----
The goal with this project is to create a full-fledged DMS based on subversion 
to handle the most common Office document file formats, 
primarily Open Document Format (ODF).
 
How to set-up subdms
--------------------
1. Install the subdms package, see INSTALL file for details.

2. Have a look in the config file /etc/subdms/subdms.cfg to see where the stuff
   gets installed, and change that if you like. Also you might want to change 
   the default editor (emacs). 

3. Initiate the server-side of subdms by running the following command in the 
   terminal:
 
   > subdms-server
   
   This will setup the workspace directory, the database and the repository.

4. Run the client by typing:
   
   > subdms

How to use
----------
Using the graphical user interface 

1. Start by adding a new project using the Menu entry "Create" -> "New Project" 

2. Creating a Document can be done in three ways using the Menu entry
   "Create" -> "New Document". 

   a. From Template: Create document from a built-in template file
   b. From File: adding a existing file to the DMS.
   c. From Document: Base the document on an existing document in the DMS.

3. List documents using Menu "Tools" -> "List Documents".

4. Edit document. Select document in the document list. 
   Use menu entry "Tools" -> "Edit Document"
   This will launch the file in editor defined in /etc/subdms/sumbdms.cfg

5. Commit Changes. As with other version control systems, local changes made to 
   the document can be commited to the central repository. 
   Select the document in the list and use "Tools" -> "Commit Changes", 
   this will launch a dialog where a commit message can be entered.

6. Check-in document. To remove the local copy of the docmuent, select the 
   document in the list and use "Tools" -> "Check-in Docmument". 
   This will commit any local changes made to the document and remove 
   the local copy form workspace.

7. Release document.

8. Create a new issue of the document.

Document list
-------------
The document list displayes information of the created documents. 
The first unnamed column displays the state of the document as follows:
    O = Document is Checked-out	  
    I = Document is Checked-in
    M = Document is localy modified


Command-line usage
------------------   
Usage: subdms add filename project doctype [title]

Example:
 > subdms add filename.txt myproject note "Techinical note"
or:
 > subdms add "this project note.txt" myproject note

This command line interface makes it possible to add documents in the DMS.
It is a compliment to add files via the graphical user interface.
And opens for the possibility to write scripts to automate the adding of files. 
If you enter a title, make sure the title is a string.
If no title is given the filename without extension is set as title.
